# # **Notebook 1.1 -- Background Mathematics**
#
# The purpose of this Python notebook is to make sure you can use CoLab and to familiarize yourself with some of the background mathematical concepts that you are going to need to understand deep learning. <br><br> It's not meant to be difficult and it may be that you know some or all of this information already.<br><br> Math is *NOT* a spectator sport.  You won't learn it by just listening to lectures or reading books.  It really helps to interact with it and explore yourself. <br><br> Work through the cells below, running each cell in turn.  In various places you will see the words **"TODO"**. Follow the instructions at these places and write code to complete the functions.  There are also questions interspersed in the text.

# **Linear functions**<br> We will be using the term *linear equation* to mean a weighted sum of inputs plus an offset. If there is just one input $x$, then this is a straight line:
#
# \begin{equation}y=\beta+\omega x,\end{equation}
#
# where $\beta$ is the y-intercept of the linear and $\omega$ is the slope of the line. When there are two inputs $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, then this becomes:
#
# \begin{equation}y=\beta+\omega_1 x_1 + \omega_2 x_2.\end{equation}
#
# Any other functions are by definition **non-linear**.
#

# Often we will want to compute many linear functions at the same time.  For example, we might have three inputs, $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ and want to compute two linear functions giving $y_1$ and $y_2$. Of course, we could do this by just running each equation separately,<br><br>
#
# \begin{align}y_1 &=& \beta_1 + \omega_{11} x_1 + \omega_{12} x_2 + \omega_{13} x_3\\
# y_2 &=& \beta_2 + \omega_{21} x_1 + \omega_{22} x_2 + \omega_{23} x_3.
# \end{align}
#
# However, we can write it more compactly with vectors and matrices:
#
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{bmatrix} y_1\\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\beta_{1}\\\beta_{2}\end{bmatrix}+ \begin{bmatrix}\omega_{11}&\omega_{12}&\omega_{13}\\\omega_{21}&\omega_{22}&\omega_{23}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}\\x_{3}\end{bmatrix},
# \end{equation}
# or
#
# \begin{equation}
# \mathbf{y} = \boldsymbol\beta +\boldsymbol\Omega\mathbf{x}.
# \end{equation}
#
# for short.  Here, lowercase bold symbols are used for vectors.  Upper case bold symbols are used for matrices.

# Let's compute two linear equations, using both the individual equations and the vector / matrix form and check they give the same result

# # Questions
#
# 1.  A single linear equation with three inputs (i.e. **linear_function_3D()**) associates a value y with each point in a 3D space ($x_1$,$x_2$,$x_3$).  Is it possible to visualize this?   What value is at position (0,0,0)?
#
# 2.  Write code to compute three linear equations with two inputs ($x_1$, $x_2$) using both the individual equations and the matrix form (you can make up any values for the inputs $\beta_{i}$ and the slopes $\omega_{ij}$.

# # Special functions
#
# Throughout the book, we'll be using some special functions (see Appendix B.1.3).  The most important of these are the logarithm and exponential functions.  Let's investigate their properties.
#
# We'll start with the exponential function $y=\exp[x]=e^x$ which maps the real line $(-\infty,+\infty)$ to positive numbers $(0,+\infty)$.

# %%
# Draw the exponential function

# Define an array of x values from -5 to 5 with increments of 0.01
x = np.arange(-5.0,5.0, 0.01)
y = np.exp(x) ;

# Plot this function
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x,y,'r-')
ax.set_ylim([0,100]);ax.set_xlim([-5,5])
ax.set_xlabel('x'); ax.set_ylabel('exp[x]')
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# # Questions
#
# 1. What is $\exp[0]$?  
# 2. What is $\exp[1]$?
# 3. What is $\exp[-\infty]$?
# 4. What is $\exp[+\infty]$?
# 5. A function is convex if we can draw a straight line between any two points on the function, and the line lies above the function everywhere between these two points. Similarly, a function is concave if a straight line between any two points lies below the function everywhere between these two points.  Is the exponential function convex or concave or neither?

# Now let's consider the logarithm function $y=\log[x]$. Throughout the book we always use natural (base $e$) logarithms. The log function maps non-negative numbers $[0,\infty]$ to real numbers $[-\infty,\infty]$.  It is the inverse of the exponential function.  So when we compute $\log[x]$ we are really asking "What is the number $y$ so that $e^y=x$?"

# %%
# Draw the logarithm function

# Define an array of x values from -5 to 5 with increments of 0.01
x = np.arange(0.01,5.0, 0.01)
y = np.log(x) ;

# Plot this function
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x,y,'r-')
ax.set_ylim([-5,5]);ax.set_xlim([0,5])
ax.set_xlabel('x'); ax.set_ylabel('$\log[x]$')
