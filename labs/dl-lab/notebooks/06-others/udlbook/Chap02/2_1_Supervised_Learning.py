# # Notebook 2.1 Supervised Learning
#
# The purpose of this notebook is to explore the linear regression model discussed in Chapter 2 of the book.
#
# Work through the cells below, running each cell in turn. In various places you will see the words "TODO". Follow the instructions at these places and write code to complete the functions. There are also questions interspersed in the text.
